# What-Is-PPL Whitepaper

# Introduction
**What-Is-PPL** is a platform for online cooperated-testing PPL (Principles of Programming Languages) subject which is taught in the HCMUT Computer Science Undergraduate Program, this subject is considered the hardest subject in all of the CS Undergraduate Program because students have to build a whole compiler for a language. There are four compulsory assignments in this subject and we can make mistakes sometimes while doing those assignments.

Cross-check is an effective and simple way to catch those mistakes; thus we decided to build this platform!

# Data Privacy
We don't save or use any of your data if it doesn't support our platform so **make sure you don't share your code with anyone and then blame this platform if you get caught for plagiarism**. 

We won't take any kind of responsibility for that.
